    <h2>About Evie</h2>
    <p>No this isn’t a dream; this is my reality. My fascination with event planning stems from my childhood. I planned my own wedding by the age of six. What started as just a little girl clipping pages from Martha Stewart Weddings evolved into a business awarded Top Wedding Planner by Martha Stewart Weddings. I built my business with a passion for connecting lasting memories to life’s most celebrated events. Now, as the south’s go-to for unique events, I’ll make your dreams a reality, too.</p>
